Project Name: Recipe Generator 

Description: The web app will allow account creation and let users enter the ingredients that they have or want to cook with. 
These will be cross-referenced with a database of recipes and possible recipes will be listed. Another feature that we may 
implement will be addition of recipes provided by the users to the database.

Possible Technologies:
React.js, Firebase, Flask, Angular.js
